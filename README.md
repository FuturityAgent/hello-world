I don't know what type in here, so I'll put here coffee recipe:
very strong black regular grind coffee, sufficient to brew 4 cups
4 tablespoons sugar
4 tablespoons heavy cream
2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon almond flavoring
crushed ice


    Add the cardamom to the ground coffee, and brew the coffee; when the coffee is brewed, add the sugar and almond flavoring, mix well and then let the coffee cool to lukewarm.
    Fill four 12 ounce highball glasses half-way to the rim with crushed ice and then fill two-thirds full with coffee; into each glass, stir about 1 tablespoon of heavy cream.
    To achieve a layered effect, hold a spoon on top of the coffee and pour the cream slowly into the spoon so that the cream floats on top of the glass over the coffee.
